            <h2>Hei</h2>My name is Luka, and I'm currently studying at Haaga-Helia. In my free time, I like to play video games and hang out with my friends. Before Haaga-Helia, I went to the military as it's mandatory here. I was in the military for a year. After that, I worked for a little while and then applied to Haaga-Helia.
